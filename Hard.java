/*How hard AI works:
 * Uses the algerithim that garuntes a draw or win
 * should be unbeatable
 * 
 * if AI goes first
 * it picks a corner
 * Player goes
 * if palyer went in a non-middle position, it goes in the opposite corner
 * player goes
 * if the player didnt block, win
 * otherwise if they went in a non-corner position, go in the middle
 * if the player went in a corner position, go in the remaigning corner
 * player goes
 * win in the remaigning opening
 * 
 * if the player origonally goes in the middle pos
 * go in the opposite corner from starting
 * block 3 in a rows and check for wins until draw
 * 
 * 
 * if AI goes second
 * it takes the middle
 * blocks and checks for win until draw
